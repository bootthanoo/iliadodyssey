After an intense Googling session, I couldn't find a free download online that is in poetry form. Eventually, I decided I would make one myself.\r\n\r\nLike, really? How is there *not* a free download of the Iliad and Odyssey in its poetry form?\r\n\r\nIan Johnston translated the I&O and posted it online under the copyright of...\r\n\r\n> They may edit the material to suit their purposes and distribute the texts in printed or electronic form to their friends and students.\r\n\r\nSo I took to Atom and Scrivener and reformatted the two books. I then compiled the books into a format for just about everybody.\r\n\r\nAnd if it is needed it in a different format, I kept the Scrivener project file for anybody to edit for their specific needs.\r\n\r\n[The Original Copyright](http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/copyright.htm)\r\n\r\n## How You Can Help\r\n\r\nIf you like this project and find any mistakes, feel free to fork this project and fix it up :)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nYou can download all the files by clicking the .zip or the .tar.gz links at the top of the page.\r\n\r\n* The Iliad\r\n * Full Books\r\n    * [PDF](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [HTML](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [txt](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [ePub](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [mobi](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n * Select Books\r\n    * [PDF](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [HTML](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [txt](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [ePub](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [mobi](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n * Individual Books\r\n    * [1](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [2](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [3](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [4](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [5](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [6](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [7](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [8](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [9](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [10](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [11](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [12](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [13](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [14](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [15](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [16](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [17](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [18](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [19](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [20](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [21](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [22](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [23](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [24](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n* The Odyssey\r\n * Full Books\r\n    * [PDF](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [HTML](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [txt](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [ePub](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [mobi](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n * Select Books\r\n    * [PDF](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [HTML](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [txt](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [ePub](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [mobi](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n * Individual Books\r\n    * [1](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [2](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [3](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [4](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [5](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [6](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [7](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [8](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [9](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [10](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [11](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [12](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [13](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [14](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [15](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [16](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [17](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [18](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [19](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [20](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [21](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [22](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [23](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n    * [24](https://bootthanoo.github.io/iliadodyssey/)\r\n",
